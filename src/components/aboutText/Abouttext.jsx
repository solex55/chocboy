                The ChocBoy Brand is a chocolate production company located in Ibadan, Nigeria. It is the first indigenous bean-to- bar chocolate production company. The company began operation as a chocolate order and delivery service in 2010 when the founder, Oluwajare Fola-Bolumole was in the University of Ibadan studying Mechanical Engineering.
                Upon graduation in 2012, the founder decided to run with the vision of pioneering the first indigenous chocolate manufacturing company in Nigeria. In October 2013, he registered the company with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria as The ChocBoy Brand. He later incorporated the company in 2020.

                Oluwajare travelled to the International Culinary Center, New York in August of 2015 to learn chocolate candy manufacturing where he developed his skill and became a chocolatier.
                Upon returning to Nigeria, Oluwajare began developing his own chocolate candy variant and tested it several times till he officially launched it in April 2016. The ChocBoy Brand became the only source of customized chocolate in Nigeria.

                With a desire to have its product in every home in Nigeria, The ChocBoy Brand began developing and testing its own chocolate spread recipe and in September 2018 developed a world leading formulation for chocolate spread. The formulation excellently balances yumminess and healthy eating in a stylish plastic jar. A spread that smears evenly on any desired surface.
                ChocBoy Chocolate Spread® got approved by NAFDAC (National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control) in November 2020 and began distribution in stores in Ibadan March2021.

            <p className='pb-8'>
                ChocBoy Chocolate Spread® is now present and available for sale in a few stores in Ibadan of which some are, FoodCo Supermarket (in 6 outlets), Feedwell Supermarket, Ace Mall, Mosh Supermarket, Wimpy Supermarket, World of Cosmetics and Shokem Supermarket.
                The ChocBoy Chocolate Spread® is a premium chocolate spread and therefore most suitable for supermarkets where people with a higher purchasing power shop.
                The product is currently put on the shelf alongside Nutella, the popular imported brand but has a better price than Nutella. It is cheaper than Nutella and Nutella fans tell us ChocBoy Chocolate Spread® is way better.            </p>
